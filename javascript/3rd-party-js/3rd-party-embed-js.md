# 3rd Party Embed JS

Third-party JavaScript is a powerful way of building embedded and highly distribut- able web applications. These applications can come in many shapes and sizes, but we looked at three specific use cases: as interactive widgets, as passive scripts that collect data, and as developer libraries that communicate with third-party web APIs. But com- pared to developing regular stay-at-home web applications, third-party scripts face additional challenges. They require you to execute your code in an unknown, shared, and potentially hostile browser environment.

Weâ€™ve only scratched the surface of what it means to write third-party scripts. In the next chapter, weâ€™ll hit the ground running by covering the front-to-back creation of an embedded widget. This is one of the most common use cases for third-party JavaScript, and serves as an excellent starting place for covering third-party concepts and challenges.
